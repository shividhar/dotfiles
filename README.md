#### TODO(shivdhar): I still need to figure out how to automate setting up
- Figuring out a new way to symlink the dotfiles in this directory to the local
  machine
- The iTerm2 settings
    - Setting up font to be Menlo for Powerline
        - Settings > Profile > Text > Font > "Menlo for Powerline"
    - Setting up the Color to be "Solarized Dark"
        - Settings > Profile > Colors > Color Preset > "Solarized Dark"
